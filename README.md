This project was undertaken by me as an academic project work in the field of 'Geographic Information Technologies'. This project is a webmap showing the various aspects of the Agriculture in India mapped on a dynamic map.

India is primarily an agricultural country. Agriculture is the mainstay of India's economy. It accounts for 26% of the gross domestic product. It ensures food security for the country and produces several raw materials for industries. Agricultural development is therefore, a precondition of our national prosperity.

Data availability in India has always been a troublesome work. Data archives in India is not upto the mark. Same is the case for agricultural data. Past/historic data of agriculture is a must to study agricultural practices in India to plan agricultural activities to boon production.

Also, the agricultural data needs to be organized and structured such that even a common man can use it at its ease. Agricultural activists/researchers can use this data to study/analyse a particular area of interest.

To address the above issues, I decided to undertake this project. The various layers and all the processing and creation of the maps was done on 'QGIS' which is a open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. Then a webmap was created using the layers exported from Qgis. 'LeafletJS' was used to build this interactive webmap along with some Html, Css and Javascript. As the data used for generating these mappings was limited, the webmap is built on a static website.

The complete source code can be found at: https://sanketdofe.github.io/geospatial_agriculture/

Any suggestions on improving this webmap would be highly appreciated!!
