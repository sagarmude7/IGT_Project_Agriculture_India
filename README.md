## About The Project 

## Technologies Used

### QGIS

QGIS is an open source geographic information system (GIS) software, allowing users to analyze and edit spatial information, in addition to composing and exporting graphical maps. QGIS supports both raster and vector layers; vector data is stored as either point, line, or polygon features. Multiple formats of raster images are supported, and the software can georeference images.

It is used in the project to perform mostly all the tasks. Tasks like creating the map, processing the data to get the required filtered data, converting the datatype as per the requirement, joining the data with the shapefiles, adding the different layers, exporting the layers, adding the OSM standard as the basemap and so on.

### MapBox
It is an open source mapping platform for custom designed maps. It has a lot of already designed templates of webmaps which can be easily added to the project.
It is used to create the webmap for our project using leaflet.

### Leaflet
Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library used for web mapping. The Leaflet library forms the basis of Mapbox.
It is used in unison with mapbox tools to create the webmap.

### Github Pages
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.
